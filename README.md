# Crazy-Grid-QR-Code
QR Code created with CSS Grid and a little of JS
QR Code created with Grid and a few lines of JS code My first challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/home. 
A great one, because I figured out some things. The problem is that I haven't respected the rules of the challenge. 
Instead of using the QR code image provided I have created the QR code image using Grid container and Grid items. :D:D:D:D:D 
I knew that I had to create a lot of divs and here is when I called ChatGPT. 
Asked it how to create a lot of divs with a short code (please notice I know very basic JS learnt 2 years ago). 
And it gave me a short script that came perfectly. Also, I have even created those two circles inside the container of the code. 
The problem I have with the project and what I don't like is that I am bad at centering. 
Finally did something but I am not pretty sure if it is ok. Somehow I have some centering. 
The responsiveness is pretty poor. For me the project was about creating the QR code. Sorry :D:D 
Please don't look in the CSS file :))))) Thank you for reading!
